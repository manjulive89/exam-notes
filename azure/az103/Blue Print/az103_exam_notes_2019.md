## AZ-103 Exam Notes

[Azure az-103 study notes]("https://thomasthornton.cloud/2019/05/07/microsoft-azure-exam-az-103-study-notes/")

AZ-103 is the newest Azure administrator exam, consisting of both the previous exams AZ-100 and AZ-101. The exam measures your ability in a number of areas including:- Azure Storage, virtual machines, virtual networks and managed identities.

Exam topics covered:-

Manage Azure subscriptions and resources (15-20%)
Implement and manage storage (15-20%)
Deploy and manage virtual machines (VMs) (15-20%)
Configure and manage virtual networks (30-35%)
Manage identities (15-20%)

A broad range of topics above, later in my blog I will include a list of study notes I used to prepare in each area including additional links that I think will be relevant.

Knowing the topics is one thing, knowing how to apply them in specific scenarios is another! Unfamiliar with a specific topic or area? I recommend deploying each resource into Azure, view the settings and look at why they may be deployed over a similar resource. Read my blog on Microsoft Azure:- Exam Preparation Tips

A general understanding of the following areas is highly recommended:

Azure Portal
AzureCLI
Powershell
ARM Templates
Hyper-V & Virtualisation on-premise configurations
Networking
VPN
